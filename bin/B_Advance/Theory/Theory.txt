Q1.What is use of dynamic variable ?
Sol: If we want to assign multiple value i.e(int, String, double) to a single variable we can use dynamic variable.

Q2.why it can be dangerous to use dynamic type variable ?
Sol: Because it is not checked at compile time, it will know at run time and at run time if you have not handled exception it can crash the program.

Q3.var vs dynamic keyword ?
Sol:Compile time check (Static) and Run time check.

Q4.What is the reason that lead to null safety ?
Sol: Suppose someone declared  a variable as i.e not assigned any value to it.
 var a;

 in this case dart internally will assign it as

 dynamic a;

 now at run time, dart will still don't know what is its type. so it will assign it to null

 a=null;

 and setting a variable to null is not a good practice. This lead to sound null safety.

 Sound null safety means dart will check using compile and run time if its null or not

 sound null safety = compile time + run time (checks)

 that is why in dart data should be NULLABLE or NON-NULLABLE always. i.e it should maintain the same if at compile time and the same
 at run time.

Q5.What is sound null safety ?
Sol: above.

Q6.What is Lint/Linting ?

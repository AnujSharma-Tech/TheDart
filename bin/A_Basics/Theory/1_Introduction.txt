1.Why Dart ?
Problem: In Google: Gmail project, it takes 20 min to rebuild the site in Javascript. Javascript
is great for small app, but it has performance issue in large app. The project to fix this issue
resulted in a new programming language Dart.

2.Who Created Dart ?
The project was assigned to Chrome Team (as they have Javascript experts) Developers:
1.Lars Bak - ex Sun Microsystems (JVM Team), Developed V8 Engine for Chrome
2.Kasper   - ex Sun Microsystems (JVM Team), Developed V8 Engine for Chrome

V8 (High Performance Javascript Engine) "While building V8, they come up with several
interesting implementation tricks to make it run fast"

3.When Dart Launched ?
2011, at the GOTO Conference, Dart was unveiled to the world
2013, Dart 1.0 was released (14-November).

4.How Dart works ?
Dart give us compilers, which converts our Dart Code to System understandable code as
Machines (Windows, Android) can understand only their own machine code.

Compilers convert: Human-Readable code -> Machine Code

For Mobile, Dart give us 2 compilers:
1.JIT (Just-in-Time (Development)): help during development. We write code and save, JIT instantly works and reflect to android device.
2.AOT (Ahead-of-Time (Production)): once development is complete, AOT converts all your code to machine code so that it can run on that
device in future without taking time. (i.e installing from play-store, so no need to compile again it save time also).

For Web, Dart give 2 Compilers:
Web (Browsers) only understand Javascript.
1.DartDevC (Development): convert to Javascript during development.
2.Dart2JS (Production): convert to Javascript finally to run on web browsers.

5.Best feature of Dart ?
- Strongly typed language: Declare type of variable.
- Null Safety
